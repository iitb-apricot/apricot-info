    <h2>What information we collect/store and when</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When a user signs up on our system, we store ONLY the phone number of the user, and assign 1000 pseudo-IDs to the user.  The pseudo-IDs are known only to the APRICOT server.</li>
        <br>
        <li>When the user is logged-in and has turned on Bluetooth, the APRICOT app announces itself to nearby APRICOT users using a pseudo-ID.  The pseudo-ID changes every 5 minutes</li>
        <br/>
        <li>When the user is logged-in and has turned on Bluetooth, the APRICOT app stores the pseudo-ID information of nearby users, along with the timestamp.  This information, called the contact trace, is stored in the app, until explicit upload to the APRICOT server (see below).</li>
        <br>
        <li>When an APRICOT user uploads (voluntarily) the contact trace from his/her app to the server, the APRICOT server comes to know the contact trace of that user.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The user can voluntarily delete his/her contact trace by uninstalling the app at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use the above information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The contact trace uploaded (voluntarily) by a user is to be viewed at the APRICOT server, ONLY by authorized medical professionals or public health officials
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>The contact trace information is to be used ONLY for the purpose of containing disease spread, in the case of a pandemic</li>
        <br>
        <li>The contact trace information is to be deleted at the APRICOT server after the period of disease containment.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>Any changes to this privacy policy will be posted at this same location, and instructors/students will be notified about the same in a transparent manner.</p>
